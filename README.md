# Media-Pipe-pose-Detection

Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated Python application that serves as a powerful tool for fitness coaches and individuals aiming to analyze workout form. By extracting frames from a video and utilizing machine learning techniques, the tool assesses exercise form, such as squats, and provides feedback and ratings on the form's correctness. This paves the way for a GPT-powered interface to deliver personalized coaching advice.

How It Works

The script processes a workout video to extract frames, particularly focusing on key positions within an exercise.
Using the VGG16 neural network model, the tool extracts deep learning features from each frame.
These features are used to perform hierarchical clustering, identifying frames that represent key stages of the workout movement.
The clusters' representative frames can be reviewed by a fitness professional or fed into a GPT model.
The GPT model is designed to analyze these frames and generate a detailed report on the workout form, providing ratings and suggestions for improvement.

Applications

Personalized Fitness Coaching: Enables trainers to offer detailed, AI-assisted feedback on clients' workout forms, enhancing the quality of online coaching.

Self-Training: Individuals can use it for self-assessment and improvement of their own workout form.

Rehabilitation: Therapists can utilize the tool to monitor patients' exercise forms and progress during physical rehabilitation.

Value Creation

Personalized Feedback: Delivers customized advice on how to improve workout form, contributing to better fitness results and reduced injury risk.

Time-Saving: Automates the time-consuming process of reviewing workout videos, freeing up time for fitness professionals to focus on personalized coaching.

Objective Analysis: Offers unbiased, consistent evaluations of workout form, aiding in the accurate assessment of performance and progress.
